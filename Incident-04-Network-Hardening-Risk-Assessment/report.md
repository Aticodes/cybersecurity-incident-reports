# Incident Title: Network Hardening and Security Risk Assessment

## 1. Objective
Assess the organization’s current security posture and recommend network hardening measures to reduce the risk of future data breaches.

## 2. Identified Risks
- Weak and shared passwords among employees
- Use of default credentials
- Lack of firewall traffic filtering
- Absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## 3. Recommended Security Controls

### Strong Password Policy and Password Management
- Enforce unique, complex passwords for all users
- Prohibit password sharing
- Implement password management tools
- Require periodic password changes

### Firewall Configuration and Network Traffic Filtering
- Configure strict inbound and outbound firewall rules
- Allow only necessary network traffic
- Regularly review and update firewall configurations

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Enable MFA for all employee and administrative accounts
- Require an additional authentication factor such as a mobile app or hardware token

## 4. Security Benefits
- Reduced risk of unauthorized access
- Protection against credential-based attacks
- Improved network visibility and control
- Stronger overall security posture

## 5. Conclusion
By implementing strong password policies, properly configured firewalls, and multi-factor authentication, the organization can significantly reduce its attack surface. Continuous monitoring, employee awareness, and regular security audits are essential to maintaining long-term security.
